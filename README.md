# Simon-Says-Game

This is Simon Says Game. Developed by me as practice exercise during the Udemy webdevelopment course.

You can access and play the game here: https://popovalexei.github.io/Simon-Says-Game/

Technologies used: HTML, CSS. JavaScript and jQuery (DOM).

How to plat the game: 
1. Press A to start the game. Firstly, the game shows the first colour in the sequence (for ex. blue). The user clicks on the blue button.
2. Next, the game shows the next colour (red), the user has to remember the sequence is blue, red and so on and so forth. If the user messes up the sequence, then the game ends.

Good luck!
