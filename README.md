Play the Simon Says Game online: [Simon Says Game](https://popovalexei.github.io/Simon-Says-Game/).

Simon Says Game is a straightforward and engaging project developed as a practical exercise during a Udemy web development course. The game draws inspiration from the classic Simon Says game, where players are tasked with accurately reproducing a sequence of colors in the precise order presented.

## Technologies Used

The game is constructed using the following technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery (DOM manipulation)

These technologies work cohesively to create an interactive and enjoyable gaming experience for users.

## How to Play

To commence the game, press the "A" key. The game will display the initial color in the sequence (e.g., blue). Click on the corresponding colored button to replicate the sequence. Subsequently, the game will reveal the next color (e.g., red), requiring you to recall and reproduce the entire sequence (e.g., blue, red). The complexity increases as the game progressively introduces additional colors to the sequence, challenging your memory and attention to detail.

Making an error and reproducing the sequence incorrectly concludes the game. Press any key to restart and embark on a new round.

Wishing you the best of luck in your Simon Says endeavors!
