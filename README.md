# Simon-Says-Game

Simon Says Game - is a simple game that I developed as a practice exercise during a Udemy web development course. The game is based on the classic Simon Says game, where the user has to repeat a sequence of colors in the correct order.

Technologies Used:

The game was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery (DOM).

How to Play:

To start the game, press the "A" key. The game will then show you the first color in the sequence (e.g. blue). Click on the blue button to repeat the sequence. The game will then show you the next color (e.g. red), and you have to remember the entire sequence (in this case, blue, red). The game will keep adding colors to the sequence, and you have to keep remembering and repeating the entire sequence in the correct order.

If you make a mistake and repeat the sequence incorrectly, the game will end. Press any key to restart the game.

Good luck!
